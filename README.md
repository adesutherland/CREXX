# CREXX

_README File - 15 May 2021_

cREXX Version: cREXX-Phase-0 v0.1.4

## REXX Language Implementation Architecture

Project to develop a modern ground up implementation of a REXX
interpreter and compiler, and experiments with language improvements.
To implement REXX using the best language tools available
today, including the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. These tools will
allow a REXX compiler to be produced supporting multiple backends
(including 64 bit architectures).

One aspect of the project is to revisit the REXX language - what can be
improved? And most importantly how can it be improved while keeping the
essence of REXX:

> to make programming easier than before

CREXX will be targeted to run on VM/370 (a nod to REXX's heritage)
and it will also run on Linux, Windows, OSX, and z/Architecture.

Please see our [project aims](Project-Aims).
