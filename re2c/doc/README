In order keep manpage, help and online documentation in sync, we generate
everything from the same RST sources. The more brief and succinct manpage docs
are located on the 'master' branch and serve as the primary source of
documentation. The more expanded and Sphinx-enhanced online docs are located on
the 'gh-pages-gen' branch; the files with '.rst_' extension (which constitute
the manpage) are pulled from the 'master' branch to 'gh-pages-gen' branch and
used together with other docs in the generation of https://re2c.org website.

Normally the general descriptio of each feature is in an '.rst_' file on
'master' branch, and examples are in '.rst' files on 'gh-pages-gen' branch.
