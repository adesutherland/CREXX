re2c works as a preprocessor. It reads the input file (which is usually a
program in the target language, but can be anything) and looks for blocks of
code enclosed in special-form comments. The text outside of these blocks is
copied verbatim into the output file. The contents of the blocks are processed
by re2c. It translates them to code in the target language and outputs the
generated code in place of the block.
