With the ``-D, --emit-dot`` option, re2c does not generate code. Instead,
it dumps the generated DFA in DOT format.
One can convert this dump to an image of the DFA using Graphviz or another library.
Note that this option shows the final DFA after it has gone through a number of
optimizations and transformations. Earlier stages can be dumped with various debug
options, such as ``--dump-nfa``, ``--dump-dfa-raw`` etc. (see the full list of options).
