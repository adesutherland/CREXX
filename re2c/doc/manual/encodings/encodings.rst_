It is necessary to understand the difference between **code points** and
**code units**. A code point is a numeric identifier of a symbol. A code unit is
the smallest unit of storage in the encoded text. A single code point may be
represented with one or more code units. In a fixed-length encoding all code
points are represented with the same number of code units. In a variable-length
encoding code points may be represented with a different number of code units.
Note that the "any" rule ``[^]`` matches any code point, but not necessarily
any code unit (the only way to match any code unit regardless of the encoding
is the default rule ``*``).
The generated lexer works with a stream of code units: ``yych`` stores a code
unit, and ``YYCTYPE`` is the code unit type. Regular expressions, on the other
hand, are specified in terms of code points. When re2c compiles regular
expressions to automata it translates code points to code units. This is
generally not a simple mapping: in variable-length encodings a single code point
range may get translated to a complex code unit graph.
The following encodings are supported:

- **ASCII** (enabled by default). It is a fixed-length encoding with code space
  ``[0-255]`` and 1-byte code points and code units.

- **EBCDIC** (enabled with ``--ebcdic`` or ``re2c:encoding:ebcdic``). It is a
  fixed-length encoding with code space ``[0-255]`` and 1-byte code points and
  code units.

- **UCS2** (enabled with ``--ucs2`` or ``re2c:encoding:ucs2``). It is a
  fixed-length encoding with code space ``[0-0xFFFF]`` and 2-byte code points
  and code units.

- **UTF8** (enabled with ``--utf8`` or ``re2c:encoding:utf8``). It is a
  variable-length Unicode encoding. Code unit size is 1 byte. Code points are
  represented with 1 -- 4 code units.

- **UTF16** (enabled with ``--utf16`` or ``re2c:encoding:utf16``). It is a
  variable-length Unicode encoding. Code unit size is 2 bytes. Code points are
  represented with 1 -- 2 code units.

- **UTF32** (enabled with ``--utf32`` or ``re2c:encoding:utf32``). It is a
  fixed-length Unicode encoding with code space ``[0-0x10FFFF]`` and 4-byte code
  points and code units.

Include file ``include/unicode_categories.re`` provides re2c definitions for the
standard Unicode categories.

Option ``--input-encoding`` specifies source file encoding, which can be used to
enable Unicode literals in regular expressions. For example
``--input-encoding utf8`` tells re2c that the source file is in UTF8 (it differs
from ``--utf8`` which sets input text encoding). Option ``--encoding-policy``
specifies the way re2c handles Unicode surrogates (code points in range
``[0xD800-0xDFFF]``).

Below is an example of a lexer for UTF8 encoded Unicode identifiers.
