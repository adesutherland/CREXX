Sentinel
--------

This example uses a sentinel character to handle the end of input. The program
counts space-separated words in a null-terminated string. The sentinel is null:
it is the last character of each input string, and it is not allowed in the
middle of a lexeme by any of the rules (in particular, it is not included in
character ranges where it is easy to overlook). If a null occurs in the middle
of a string, it is a syntax error and the lexer will match default rule ``*``,
but it won't read past the end of input or crash (use
`-Wsentinel-in-midrule <https://re2c.org/manual/warnings/warnings.html#wsentinel-in-midrule>`_
warning and ``re2c:sentinel`` configuration to verify this). Configuration
``re2c:yyfill:enable = 0;`` suppresses the generation of bounds checks and
``YYFILL`` invocations.
