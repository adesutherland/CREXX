re2c allows one to generate header file from the input ``.re`` file using option
``-t``, ``--type-header`` or configuration ``re2c:flags:type-header`` and
directives ``/*!header:re2c:on*/`` and ``/*!header:re2c:off*/``. The first directive
marks the beginning of header file, and the second directive marks the end of
it. Everything between these directives is processed by re2c, and the generated
code is written to the file specified by the ``-t --type-header`` option (or
``stdout`` if this option was not used). Autogenerated header file may be needed
in cases when re2c is used to generate definitions of constants, variables and
structs that must be visible from other translation units.

Here is an example of generating a header file that contains definition of the
lexer state with tag variables (the number variables depends on the regular
grammar and is unknown to the programmer).
