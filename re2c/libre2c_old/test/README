This directory contains the unit tests for the re2c library.
To run the tests, simply run the executable with no arguments.

	zutest: the unit tests for the zutest unit test library.
		(note that some tests should fail)

	retest: the unit tests for the re2c library.

Right now only the compare example contains unit tests.
TODO: write more.  In particular, read_shiftbuf seems a
good candidate for unit tests.  Also maybe the error handling.
