This directory contains a number of programs that demonstrate how
to use the re2c library.


skeleton: Get started quick by filling in the blanks.

numscan-coupled: a very simple scanner and parser contained in a
	single file.  Its documentation is inteded to be used as a tutorial.

numscan-modular: Separates numscan-coupled into separate a separate
	scanner and parser.  Also shows how to read data using fopen/fread.
	Also intended to be used as a tutorial.

startstate: How to use start states.  Implements a scanner that recognizes
	C-style comments by swiching start states depending on whether it's
	currently parsing a comment or not.

compare: The re2c library can be useful even if you don't actually need
	a scanner.  For example, recently I needed to compare two bytestreams
	without reading either one entirely into memory.  Readprocs are a
	good way of implementing this surprisingly complex task.
