You need tmtest to run the testfiles in this directory.

tmtest is still very very prerelease.  You probably don't want to
use it until it reaches 0.98 or so.


TODO: should write functional tests to ensure that this code handles
		read errors correctly.  That requires a custom readproc that
		piggybacks onto the original readproc, returns a certain number
		of bytes, then returns an error.  Not hard, but I won't do it
		tonight...
