        Fix String Compare
        Fix Assembler Keyhole Optimiser confusing register types (r,a,g)
I0205 - Flexible source file extension
I0265 - Fixed Segfault when there is a duplicate procedure definition
F0031 - VM Performance Optimisations
F0035 - (Almost) complete REXX/RXAS BIF library
I0226 - Support an empty SAY command
I0180 - Loop TO check is not right for a negative BY value
I0177 - Implement LOOP as a synonym for DO in loops
I0183 - Fix loop fails with empty do
I0182 - Fix RXC sometimes goes into a loop when compiling loops/assignments
F0037 - REXX Loop Constructs (UNTIL, WHILE, FOREVER, LEAVE, ITERATE)
        RXAS bcf instruction
I0172 - Fixed RXC generating idivi instruction. Includes adding missing
        idiv_reg_int_reg and imod instructions. Deprecated divi and related
        convert and calculate instructions
I0169 - Fixed comparison operators picking up child1's value type not its target type
I0159 - Fixed Compiler does not issue an error when a comment is not closed
I0156 - Fixed Duplicate Labels.
      - Improved readability of generated RXAS labels
      - Performance Improvement for AND and OR logic
      - New C-Opt rules to optimise brt/f to brt/f branches
F0036 - COVID-Opt Assembler Keyhole Optimiser
      - Initial set of C-Opt rules:
        - swaps cancelling each other out
        - concat to append
        - br to brt/brf/brtf
      - Jump to unconditional jump Assembler Optimiser
      - BranchTrueFalse (BRTF) - Branch with two destinations
      - String append instructions (APPEND/SAPPEND)
I0I49 - Compiler error - does not take account os a swap interfering with a return register
      - Segfault when the return register is also used as a argument
I0146 - Compiler not always setting typeflags of arguments correctly
I0134 - Imported procedure name as "func.func"- temp workaround
F0034 - Optional Procedure Arguments
F0023 - Show hex of instructions in disassembler
F0030 - Fixes, BIF Functions, RXAS Instructions and RXVM Optimisations
      - Prefix operators (~, +, -)
F0032 - Document rexx bifs from standard (in docs/bifs)
I0081 - UTF Char Positioning Fix
F0018 - CALL, RETURN, ARG support (without PARSE)
F0028 - rxc level B embedded REXX ASSEMBLER
      - initial function() parsing (not complete)
      - Fix UTF whitespace/tab (rxc and rxas)
      - Fix rxas did not accept negative floats
      - Fix rxc do repeat segfault with a non-integer loop counter
      - Fix rxc optimiser turns loop variable to a constant
      - Refactor rxc - ASTNode to Symbol Connector now a object so that
        relationship attributes are supported; read/write attributes needed for
        optimiser
F0026 - Constant Folding and Constant Propagation Compiler Optimiser
        Taken constants support
        IF constant optimisation
        Logical AND/OR Constant Optimisation
        Lazy AND/OR expression evaluation
        Use of the constant version of instructions
        Updated TRACE messages to use rxas format
        float and string comparison functions
        say instruction rationalisation (say reg as string with a newline added only)
I0061 - Fix Issue 61 - itof instruction missing

        Updated instructions to seq, sne
        New instructions appendchar, strlen, getstrpos, setstrpos, strchar
        S370 build updates
        Initial assembler and rexx test scripts on build
F0017 - Feature - Linking Multiple Modules
I0053 - Fix Issue 53 - String Concat Errors
