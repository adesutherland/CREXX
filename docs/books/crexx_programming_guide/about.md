# About This Book

The \crexx{} language is a further development, and variant of the
\textsc{Rexx} language\footnote{Cowlishaw, 1979}. This book aims to
document the workings of this implementation and serves as reference
for users and implementers alike.

## Programming Guide

This Programming Guide focuses on documenting the
tools delivered with \crexx{}, from a usage perspective. The technical
background and design documentation is in the \emph{\crexx{} VM
  Specification} (this includes information on how to build the tools
from source), while the programming language itself is defined in
the \emph{\crexx{} Language Definition} document.

This document includes practical examples, best practices, and code
snippets that illustrate how to perform common tasks, such as setting
up the environment, handling data input and output, processing user
input, and interacting with other software components.

\section*{Audience}
This Programming Guide is aimed at developers who want to use \crexx{} to create an application or integrate it into an existing system.

## History

  release, Q1 2026 and is intended for developers only. It documents
