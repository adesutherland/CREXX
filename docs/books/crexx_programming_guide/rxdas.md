# rxdas - the \crexx{} Disassembler

A disassembler reverses the actions of an assembler; where the
assembler turns a text file containing unstrictions and directives
into a binary executable, the disassembler returns this binary file
into its text form\footnote{as much as possible, given the fact that
  some information on literals has disappeared};in this case it
delivers a disassembly which in itself can be re-assembled - and still
works. 

## Input/Output

The \code{rxdas} disassembler has a \code{.rxbin} file as input and
produces a text file as output which goes to \code{stdout}. In this
text file a disassembly has taken place; labels are synthetic and
based on the combination of instructions around them. As clearly can
be seen in the above, the labels generated by the \crexx{} compiler
are not the same as the ones generated by the disassembler. With
option \code{-p}, the constant pool of the \code{.rxbin} file is
printed first, before the rest of the disassembly. 

## Command Line Arguments

When the command line argument -h is specified the options are shown:\\
\fontspec{IBM Plex Mono}
\begin{shaded}
  \small
  \obeylines \splice{rxdas -h | sed "s/&/\and/g"}
 \end{shaded}
 \fontspec{TeX Gyre Pagella}

## Example

 \lstinputlisting[language=rexx,label=disasm,caption=disasmexample]{examples/sumLoop1000.rexx}
 % \splice{rxc examples/sumLoop1000} \obeylines
 \lstinputlisting[language=rxas,label=disasm1,caption=disasmexample1]{examples/sumLoop1000.rxas}
 \splice{rxas examples/sumLoop1000}
This program contains the generated assembler as the \code{rxc}
produces it from the \textsc{Rexx} source. What follows is the
disassembly from the assembled \code{.rxbin'} file.

## Remarks

<!--  The zebra fanfold has the output of the disassembler; the procedure name, -->
<!--  \code{main}, is identical, but the first label generated by the -->
<!--  compiler, \code{l7dostart:} is called \code{lb_9} in the disassembler -->
<!--  output. This is of no consequence for a subsequent re-assembly and -->
<!--  execution of the program. -->

<!--  The instructions can be different due to the optimizations the -->
<!--  assembler performs. When the compiler has performed optimizations, -->
<!--  this is already visible in the \code{.rxas} file. -->

<!-- Also, the disassembler affixes the standard instruction documentation, -->
<!-- which is the same as generated by \code{rxas -i}, in a line comment -->
<!-- after the instructions.  -->
 
<!--  When stepping through a program using the \crexx{} Debugger (which is -->
<!--  mentioned in the next chapter), the disassembly is the most -->
<!--  representative record of what is in the \code{.rxbin} executable.  -->
