\chapter{rxcpack - the \crexx{} C Packer}
The C Packer program converts the \emph{.rxbin} files into a C
language structure which links together all needed modules, and a
large part of the Virtual Machine infrastructure, which file then can
be compiled and link edited by the C compiler. GCC and Clang are the
targeted compiler toolchains for Linux, macOS and Windows.
