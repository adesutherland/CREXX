\chapter*{About This Book}
The \crexx{} language is a further development, and variant of the
\textsc{Rexx} language\footnote{Cowlishaw, 1979}. This book aims to
document the workings of this implementation and serves as reference
for users and implementors alike. It focus it the instruction set of
the `rxvm` virtual machine which is the base of the code generated
by the `rxc` compiler for the `rxas` assembler.

It documents the RXAS instruction set and \crexx{} level B, which is a
typed subset of Classic Rexx. \crexx{} level B features access to assembler
level from Rexx source, so in addition to documenting the inner workings
of the \crexx{} toolchain, this reference is useful for application
programmers who need this level of access.
