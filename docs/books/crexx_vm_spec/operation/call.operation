A call instruction calls a procedure, which can be local, from a library or from a statically or dynamically linked plugin or VM plugin. In the example, the returncode is deposited by the called produre in the third operand register, the called procedure is specified in the second operand, FUNC field, as a procedure (ending in parentheses). The third operand register contains the register name of the first argument passed to the procedure, as per the \crexx{} linking convention. The other arguments are in adjacent higher numbered registers. The called procedure must be linked in with an \code{.expose} statement, as on line 17 of the example.
