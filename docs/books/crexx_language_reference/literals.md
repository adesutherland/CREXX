# Literals

A literal is a fixed value that appears directly in a program's source code. It can be a string of characters, a numeric value, or a Boolean value. Literals are used to represent constant data that does not change during the execution of a program.

## **String Literals**

A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. It represents a constant value in a program.

## **Numeric Literals**

Numeric literals can be integers, floating-point numbers, or hexadecimal numbers. Integers are whole numbers that do not have a decimal point. Floating-point numbers are numbers that have a decimal point.

## **Hex/Binary literals**

A string literal that concludes with an “x” (such as “abcd”x) signifies a hexadecimal literal. Conversely, a string literal that concludes with a "b" denotes a binary string.
