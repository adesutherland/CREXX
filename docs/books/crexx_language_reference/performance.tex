\section{Performance}

For precise technical documentation, we refer to the \emph{\crexx{} VM Specification} publication, which contains the last word on the architecture and implementation of the bytecode compiler, the assembler and the first two virtual machines. One of these is a conventional byte code interpreter, the other is a \emph{threaded code interpreter}. These share over 99\% of their source code.

The virtual machine executing the \rexx assembler instructions is written according to a strict set of rules that limits the possibility of pipeline stalls in modern processor architectures.
