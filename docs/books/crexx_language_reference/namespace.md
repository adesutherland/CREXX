# Namespace {#namespace}

In Rexx programming, the "namespace" instruction plays a crucial role in organizing and structuring modules within a program. It allows you to define a unique identifier for a module, enabling multiple modules to coexist within the same program while maintaining their own identity and scope.

The namespace instruction is used after the "options" instruction in a Rexx program. By specifying a namespace, you define the logical group or category to which a particular module belongs. This helps in organizing related modules together and facilitates their identification and usage from other modules within the program.

One of the key benefits of using namespaces is that it allows you to control the exposure of procedures, members, and globals from one module to another. When you define a namespace, you can specify which elements of that module will be visible and accessible to other modules. This enhances modularity and encapsulation by limiting the scope of variables and procedures to specific namespaces, preventing potential conflicts and promoting code reusability.

If a module does not explicitly include a namespace instruction, Rexx automatically assigns it to a default namespace based on the file name. The default namespace is derived from the file name without the ".rexx" file type. 

By leveraging namespaces, Rexx programmers can create modular and well-organized programs, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and reusability. Namespaces promote a structured approach to program design, allowing developers to group related functionality together and control the visibility of elements across different modules.
