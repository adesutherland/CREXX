\chapter*{About This Book}
The \crexx{} language is a further development, and variant of the
\textsc{Rexx} language\footnote{Cowlishaw, 1979}. This book aims to
document the workings of this implementation and serves as reference
for users and implementors alike.

\section*{Application Programming Guide}
This \emph{Application Programming Guide} focuses on documenting the
tools delivered with \crexx{}, from a usage perspective. The technical
background and design documentation is in the \emph{\crexx{} VM
  Specification} (this includes information on how to build the tools
from source), while the programming language itself is defined in
the \emph{\crexx{} Language Definition} document.
