Quick Start Guide & This guide is meant for an audience that has done some programming and wants to start quickly. It starts with a quick tour of the language, and a section on installing the \nr{} translator and how to run it. It also contains help for troubleshooting if anything in the installation does not work as designed, and states current limits and restrictions of the open source reference implementation.
\\\midrule
Programming Guide & The Programming Guide is the one manual that at the same time teaches programming, shows lots of examples as they occur in the real world, and explains about the internals of the translator and how to interface with it.
\\\midrule
Language Reference & Referred to as the NRL, this is meant as the formal definition for the language, documenting its syntax and semantics, and prescribing minimal functionality for language implementers.
\\\midrule
Pipelines Guide \& Reference & The Data Flow oriented companion to \nr{}, with its CMS Pipelines compatible syntax, is documented in this manual. It discusses running Pipes for \nr{} in the command shell and the Workspace, and has ample examples of defining your own stages in \nr{}.
